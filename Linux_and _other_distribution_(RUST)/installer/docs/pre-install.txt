SFT (Secure File Transfer) is a highly secure file transfer system using
state-of-the-art cryptography:

- ECDH (X25519) for key exchange
- Ed25519 for digital signatures
- AES-256-GCM for authenticated encryption
- Rust-accelerated cryptographic operations

- Visual C++ Redistributable 2015-2022 (will be installed if missing)

What Will Be Installed
-----------------------
- Python 3.11 embedded runtime (~30 MB)
- SFT application files
- Rust crypto_accelerator module (high-performance cryptography)
- Required Python dependencies (cryptography, PyNaCl, etc.)
- Launcher scripts for easy access

Installation Directory
----------------------
Default: C:\Program Files\SFT\

The installer will:
- Create application directory
